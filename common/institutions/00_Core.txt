# remember to add graphics for relevant ones when you add to this

# if a modifier is scaled, its multiplied with development in the province.


# any_friendly_coast_border_province is a special scope made for institution spread.
# It checks for adjacent provinces or provinces one seazone away.
# Friendly is defined as at positive relations or owned by the same country that owns the province.
