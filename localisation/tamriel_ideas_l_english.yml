  XAT_custom_ideas: "Atron Ideas"
  XAT_custom_ideas_bonus: "Atron Ambitions"
  XAT_custom_ideas_start: "Atron Traditions"
  XAT_idea_1: "Velothi Roots"
  XAT_idea_1_desc: "The Atron plain has not always been Argonian land. Our greatest city, Archon, was reputedly founded by Velothi Dunmer; over the following centuries, it became a melting pot of peoples that every so often descended into war. Although this legacy was all but ended by the Knahaten Flu, we have never ceased to look back on the Velothi, Lilmothiit and Kothringi, and we can use this to build an Atron society distinct from our cousins in the marsh."
  XAT_idea_2: "Let Gold Mean Nothing"
  XAT_idea_2_desc: "A land with the best Alteration mages in Tamriel sometimes faces unique problems. One of these is that of currency. Using gold coins, like the old Cyrodilic septims, simply doesn't work, as silver is easily transmutable into gold by Alteration mages. Therefore, we must turn away from metal, and use enchanted daedra remains as currency. This also has the added benefit of letting us manipulate the currency by changing which daedra are used."
  XAT_idea_3: "Settler-Form Dominance"
  XAT_idea_3_desc: "Atronium is one of the few societies in Argonia where settler-form Argonians - referred to by ignorant outsiders as \"female\" Argonians - are held in higher esteem than hunter-form Argonians. Thus, our leaders are some of the least arrogant and least reckless on the continent. As settler-forms have a natural talent for magic and scholarly learning rather than tracking whatever beast happens to be in the right kind of swamp, Atron administrative and military methods tend to be more advanced than in some other parts of eastern Tamriel."
  XAT_idea_4: "Port of Nansyokka"
  XAT_idea_4_desc: "Argonians have a profoundly different outlook on some parts of life than men and mer. Atrons are perhaps the least reactionary people in Argonia. The combination of these two factors results in many non-Argonians with certain tendencies moving to Atronium in order to do what they will without persecution. Nansyokka, a port near Enganka, has become famous for such things, and its renown makes traders with ulterior motives more likely to be persuaded to trade there."
  XAT_idea_5: "Land Beyond the Marshes"
  XAT_idea_5_desc: "Atronium is mostly plains, but it is separated from the rest of Tamriel by Murkwood and the Black Marshes. When in those treacherous regions, the idea of the eternal swampy jungle actually ending becomes fanciful, and so Atronium has acquired a sort of promised-land status in the rest of Tamriel. Because of this, many people who were outsiders in their homeland have set off southeast, hoping to reach Archon or Jer Vanyal. These immigrants bring intriguing ideas from the rest of Tamriel with them, and can be very useful to the Atron state!"
  XAT_idea_6: "Atron Pride"
  XAT_idea_6_desc: "We are not denizens of the Black Marshes. We do not spend our days running through jungle, trying to remember what is poison and what is not. And our language consists of more than one-word sentences. We are not like those in Helstrom and Blackrose - we are Atron, and none of us will forget that!"
  XAT_idea_7: "Military Alteration"
  XAT_idea_7_desc: "Why must Alteration be used only for lock-picking and party tricks? The ability to change the world around us is an incredibly powerful tool in the right hands. Yet nobody has used it for military matters yet. We cannot understand why. We should create specialised Alteration military corps, so when our armies next meet the enemy, they will find their swords have turned to quicksilver before they land a single blow."
  argonian_idea_1: "Hunting Traditions"
  argonian_idea_1_desc: "Where the soft-skinned outlanders see nothing but impenetrable jungle and marsh, we see our homeland, and it is as bountiful as any of those arbitrary rectangles of grain the Cyrodiils appear to subsist on. Every plant, fungus, fish and beast of the Black Marshes can be used for something; if not food, then medicine, or perhaps a poison to defeat larger creatures. And yet the Cyrodiils say that their way, their way of sitting around while eating the same food day after day, is \"civilisation\"? They will soon see how wrong they are when they first set foot in our Argonia and try and cook a trodh fish."
  argonian_idea_2: "Argonia the Treacherous"
  argonian_idea_2_desc: "Many invaders have tried to tame the swamps and jungles of Murkwood and Karanake. Few have lived to tell the tale, and none have succeeded: even the supposed might of the Septim Empire ruled three cities in western Argonia and left it at that. For how can Cyrodiils or Dunmer even reach Helstrom, the heart of our homeland, when it is surrounded by the most impenetrable land in all Tamriel?"
  argonian_idea_3: "Free Argonians"
  argonian_idea_3_desc: "Since the Daedra of Mehrunes Dagon stalked our continent, we have declared official independence from Cyrodiil, throwing off the shackles that have kept our north constantly threatened by Dres slavers and our west presided over by Imperial money-makers. Now Argonia is free, and nobody will take that freedom away again."
  argonian_idea_4: "Riding the Roots"
  argonian_idea_4_desc: "Beneath Argonia lies an intricate system of wide, hollow roots, inhabited by curious worm-like creatures larger than any Argonian. Our people have long used these as a kind of inland trade-wind, \"riding the roots\" from one side of Argonia to the other in the space of a few hours. Of course, they cannot be relied on, and change with the seasons; but every so often, the roots align, and our armies can strike deep into the heart of our enemies' land."
  argonian_idea_5: "Expand the Hist"
  argonian_idea_5_desc: "Although we are free people, every one of us knows that we have some unassailable duty to the Hist, the great trees scattered across Argonia that are vital to almost any Argonian ritual one can think of. But why must the Hist be limited to Argonia? If we can take more foreign land, then we could expand Argonia by encouraging Hist trees to take root in newly-created swamp, ensuring the continuation of our culture in an ever-expanding area of Tamriel."
  argonian_idea_6: "Hist Gender"
  argonian_idea_6_desc: "Argonians do not have genders in the Cyrodilic sense of the term: our people are either hunter-form or settler-form, the former being naturally adapted to survival in the deep marshes while the latter has adapted to more cerebral matters. Which form an Argonian becomes is generally decided with Hist sap close to birth, but an Argonian's form can still change with the ingestion of more Hist sap. Therefore, in times of war, we should increase our fighting force by encouraging willing settler-form Argonians to become hunter-forms for the duration of the war effort."
  argonian_idea_7: "Impenetrable Language"
  argonian_idea_7_desc: "The Jel or Histic languages native to Argonia are seen across Tamriel as perhaps the hardest languages for an outsider to understand. In particular, the language found in central Argonia is closer to raw thought than to other languages, with some sentences consisting of just one word with large helpings of intonation and context. This impenetrability should make sure that Argonian secrets are never leaked to the outside world."
  argonian_ideas: "Inner Argonian Ideas"
  argonian_ideas_bonus: "Inner Argonian Ambitions"
  argonian_ideas_start: "Inner Argonian Traditions"
  XSE_custom_ideas: "Seydani Ideas"
  XSE_custom_ideas_bonus: "Seydani Ambitions"
  XSE_custom_ideas_start: "Seydani Traditions"
  XSE_idea_1: "Old Gideon"
  XSE_idea_1_desc: "Gideon, the capital of Seydahnil, has been the chief trading city of western Argonia for centuries. The Septim legacy, in particular, has left Gideon with excellent trading infrastructure, which we can still use to our advantage now we are independent - our eternal rival in trade, Leyawiin, had better watch out..."
  XSE_idea_2: "Cyrod Connections"
  XSE_idea_2_desc: "Although we have thrown off the shackles of Cyrodilic rule, our people were among the last Argonians to formally declare independence, and there are still some in Blackwood who sympathise with our new nation. By portraying ourselves as a nation which looks west as well as east, we can gain more influence in southern Cyrodilic matters."
  XSE_idea_3: "The Foxfire Coast"
  XSE_idea_3_desc: "The coast south of Gideon is home to several strange species of plants and fungi, which seem to naturally glow after the sun sets. Other than inspiring mages to make their home in south Seydahnil, and drawing countless admirers from all over Tamriel, the so-called Foxfire Coast helps our ships see more clearly at night. Perhaps we could find a way to make other coasts glow in the same way..."
  XSE_idea_4: "Gideon Tower"
  XSE_idea_4_desc: "Gideon is a very old city. Some have even said that a settlement around modern Gideon has existed since the Ayleid days, although Seydahnil never seems to have ever been anything other than Argonian. However, there is a strange, prehistoric tower in the middle of Gideon, its sheer size and stark contrast to the rest of the city ensuring that it dominates the sky. That tower has never fallen, even in the face of so many waves of invaders. And as long as the tower remains standing, Gideon will never fall again, we are sure of it."
  XSE_idea_5: "Melting Pot"
  XSE_idea_5_desc: "Gideon's position at the centre of Western Argonian trade has attracted men and mer from all over Tamriel, and some who are reputed to be from lands beyond it. Their influence is such that the speech of Gideon has morphed into something unintelligible to those living outside it - even other Seydani Argonians find it confusing. With all these foreign people come foreign ideas - we don't need to work as hard as most states do when dealing with problems of administration, as somewhere has probably already found a solution, and there are most likely people already in Seydahnil hailing from that somewhere."
  XSE_idea_6: "Seydani Conjuration"
  XSE_idea_6_desc: "Seydahnil has a history of producing Conjuration mages, in contrast to the Mysticism of Leyawiin and the Alteration of Archon. In particular, the summoning of daedra has long been a Seydani speciality, making the Oblivion Crisis somewhat easier to handle than in other parts of Tamriel. This has had many other effects, including Seydani portals being partially responsible for the formation of Akasunde, but one particularly important one is the reduced cost of armies - we can easily replace some of the men in our armies with daedric thralls."
  XSE_idea_7: "Blurred Identity"
  XSE_idea_7_desc: "As the westernmost part of Argonia, Seydahnil has sometimes been seen as a proxy for Cyrodiil by eastern Argonians. However, in Cyrodiil, Seydahnil is sometimes seen as a proxy for Argonia. This has created a situation where an independent Seydahnil can to some extent manipulate its identity to best suit its interests. We may be Argonian, or Cyrodilic. But we will never be truly foreign to either side."
  XTE_custom_ideas: "Telvanni Ideas"
  XTE_custom_ideas_bonus: "Telvanni Ambitions"
  XTE_custom_ideas_start: "Telvanni Traditions"
  XTE_idea_1: "Mushroom Towers"
  XTE_idea_1_desc: "Perhaps more than anything else, we Telvanni are known for our distinctive homes and castles that look unlike any other in Tamriel. Through complex magic involving fungal spores and soul gems, we make our towns and cities from fungi, not bricks or stone. Quite apart from looking impressive and imposing, fungal towers have many advantages over the crude dwellings of less advanced peoples – they can be fashioned to keep out anyone who cannot levitate, and – crucially – if one knows the relevant magic, they are much more convenient to grow than brick houses are to build."
  XTE_idea_2: "Ruthless Meritocracy"
  XTE_idea_2_desc: "Why should birth have any bearing on our leadership? Rather than copy the Cyrodiils and make any fool our ruler so long as he has the right father, we will simply make the life of higher Telvanni intensive, highly political, and above all, requiring great magical ability, to the extent that if the Archmagister is killed by another Telvanni lord, they will become the new Archmagister! In this way, we will never have a weak ruler. Why should we have to put up with one?"
  XTE_idea_3: "Telvanni-Style Colonisation"
  XTE_idea_3_desc: "Our mushroom towers can be grown anywhere, from the rocky, storm-swept northern shores of the Molagreahd to the volcanic wastes of the Molag Amur. What’s more, once we conquer a town, we can quickly and easily grow a serviceable Telvanni fortress right next to it, making it clear to the inhabitants who their new kings are!"
  XTE_idea_4: "Trading in Bug Musk"
  XTE_idea_4_desc: "Some outlanders think of the Telvanni lands mainly as Tamriel’s source of bug musk, a perfume that apparently makes the wearer wonderfully attractive in some way. Whether or not it works, not only is this export wonderful for Telvanni reputation overseas, it means that traders will always have one expensive product that they are forced to buy from our land. What could be wrong with that?"
  XTE_idea_5: "Godless Mages"
  XTE_idea_5_desc: "Telvanni masters have little time for gods – especially not Aedra, who don’t even seem to do much when they’re summoned. Even Daedric Princes have been known to get the cold shoulder from particularly aloof Telvanni engaged in a complex experiment. What all this means in practice is that, as we look down on every religion, nobody in any lands we might conquer can accuse us of favouritism."
  XTE_idea_6: "Telvanni Experimentation"
  XTE_idea_6_desc: "Who are the people who are unafraid to carry out magical experiments which might be taboo in half the continent? Who are the people who experiment on men and mer rather than relying entirely on rats and dogs? Who are the people who turn whole cave systems into places where even the most fearless adventurer would think twice before going anywhere near them? Who, in other words, are the people who magical progress all but completely relies on? We Telvanni, of course."
  XTE_idea_7: "No to Ebonheart!"
  XTE_idea_7_desc: "During the War of the Three Banners, most of our fellow Dunmer betrayed their ancestors and entered into a pact with our hated enemies to the west and to the south. To enter an alliance with either Nords or Argonians is treasonous enough: to enter one with both at once doesn’t even bear thinking of. Tamriel still remembers how the Telvanni refused to join the Morrowind government in this so-called Ebonheart Pact, and we are proud of that fact to this day."
  axadni_ideas: "Axadni Ideas"
  axadni_ideas_bonus: "Axadni Ambitions"
  axadni_ideas_start: "Axadni Traditions"
  axadni_idea_1: "Necromancy!"
  axadni_idea_1_desc: "This part of Argonia is known as a haven for necromancers. Nobody knows how it started, especially seeing as Argonia isn’t the best climate for it. Whatever the cause, though, those parts of Tamriel which look down on the practice, such as Cyrodiil, end up inadvertently forcing some of their most talented citizens to flee… and many end up here in Axadnia. Having so many necromancers around has benefits, not least in wartime. For we will not limit ourselves to living soldiers..."
  axadni_idea_2: "Hist Shrines"
  axadni_idea_2_desc: "Axadnia boasts some of Argonia’s most famous xanmeer and Hist shrines, strange places of worship that look like nothing else on the continent. While the various Hist-based rituals are impossible for outlanders to understand, within Argonia, control of some of the greatest shrines still conveys great prestige on the rulers of this region."
  axadni_idea_3: "Mage Strongholds"
  axadni_idea_3_desc: "We don’t need to fortify our land much – our inhabitants do it for themselves. Towns such as Saranyth, Dacynne, and Asashpan are veritable citadels of the swamps, redoubts of mages who do not look kindly on anything or anyone from outside their town seeing what’s inside without being watched. Imagine the enemy trying to invade Axadnia, expecting nothing but marshland villages, and seeing the venerable walls of Saranyth loom ahead of them!"
  axadni_idea_4: "The Parchlands"
  axadni_idea_4_desc: "The coast between Soulrest and Maradra still bears the scars of the era of Imperial tyranny. Attempts to replace our beloved hunting culture with money-making plantations led to that coastline becoming unable to support much life, leading to the creation of a dull landscape unlike any other in Argonia. At the very least, though, until it returns to its former splendour, the terrain is not as hard to traverse as proper Argonian jungle."
  axadni_idea_5: "Khajiti Immigrants"
  axadni_idea_5_desc: "Axadnia lies directly opposite the Quin’rawl Peninsula in Elsweyr, over the Topal Bay, and our people have enjoyed connections with the western neighbours for centuries. Recently, it has become fairly commonplace for Khajiit who wish to leave Elsweyr to set their sights on Soulrest instead of Cyrodiil, due to the latter’s instability and reports of Khajiti slums in Bravil and Leyawiin. Not only have these new arrivals created a thriving cross-bay trade from Soulrest to Senchal, they have introduced new merchant traditions that are sometimes more effective than the Argonian ones when dealing with men and mer."
  axadni_idea_6: "Imperial Dacyn Road"
  axadni_idea_6_desc: "The Imperial Dacyn Road, a paved route from Soulrest to Gideon, is often referred to by Axadni Argonians as the only good thing Cyrodiil ever did in all Argonia. Connecting Soulrest, Kutagasi, Dacynne, and Maradra to wider Tamriel, although perhaps not the most Argonian thing to do, at least gives us some trade advantages with our northern neighbours."
  axadni_idea_7: "Land of Argonian Mystery"
  axadni_idea_7_desc: "Welcome to a land of step pyramids shrouded in mist, a land of abandoned plantations taken over by outliers from the Khajiti diaspora, a land of fortresses rising improbably from the marshes, a land of the countless myths and legends surrounding places like the Kulan Lake… a land where half of your neighbour’s household might well be technically dead, and nobody minds. Welcome to Axadnia. You’d better believe that everything we say is true, because however outlandish it is, it’s best not to assume it’s false when it might well not be."
  nordic_ideas: "Nordic Ideas"
  nordic_ideas_bonus: "Nordic Ambitions"
  nordic_ideas_start: "Nordic Traditions"
  nordic_idea_1: "First from Atmora"
  nordic_idea_1_desc: "We Nords were the first men to set foot on Tamriel, when Ysgramor landed his men at Hsaarik Head, as every Nord knows. All other men on this continent, therefore, are simply pale impersonations of true Nords. And sooner or later, any human historian anywhere in Tamriel will grow to revere the land of Skyrim. Surely, we should rule Cyrodiil, not the other way round?"
  nordic_idea_2: "The Cold White North"
  nordic_idea_2_desc: "Travellers speak of the endless deserts of Anequina, the impenetrable forests of Valenwood, the burning ashlands of Morrowind, and the treacherous swamps of Argonia. But anyone who has travelled to inner Skyrim will agree that, however many unpleasant insects the south might have, they are no preparation for the north, where it feels as if the entire sky is casting one great frost spell. And yet, it is our home. Outlanders… aren’t so lucky, to say the least."
  nordic_idea_3: "Nordic Rites of Passage"
  nordic_idea_3_desc: "The Nordic people know how important it is to make sure that every one of their number knows how to fight. So we send our young people off to fight ice wraiths and the like when they come of age. Yes, we lose a few sometimes, but is that not a price worth paying for a land without the sheer numbers of milk-drinkers that inhabit the south?"
  nordic_idea_4: "Skyrim's Silver"
  nordic_idea_4_desc: "Despite our claims to be the true kings of all men, the Septims didn’t conquer Skyrim to eliminate a challenger, or even for the prestige. No: the culprit was our bountiful silver mines, which the Cyrodiils have been exploiting for centuries. It goes without saying that not much of it actually stays in Skyrim. But… now the Septims are gone, we can change that."
  nordic_idea_5: "Honour the Pantheon"
  nordic_idea_5_desc: "Religion up here doesn’t work exactly the same way as it does in Cyrodiil. Our old animist tradition, coupled with Elven, Aedric and Daedric influences, has led us to worship a pantheon comprised of both Aedra and Daedra. They both exist, so why anger one god or another? Furthermore, the southern Nine Divines religion doesn’t recognise the existence of the great Shor. We know that they’re wrong, of course, but that Nordic syncretism might come in useful when conquering other lands."
  nordic_idea_6: "Forts of the First Men"
  nordic_idea_6_desc: "Saarthal. Labyrinthian. Korvanjund. These names have been uttered since ancient times, since before places like Cyrodiil City or Mournhold even existed. Skyrim’s long and rich history has left it with castles, forts, and redoubts everywhere. So even if we lose a major city, there will always be somewhere nearby that we can fight back from, when the enemy least expect it."
  nordic_idea_7: "To Sovngarde!"
  nordic_idea_7_desc: "We are Nords. All of us, if we die properly in battle, can look forward to eternity in Sovngarde, our afterlife, where the mead never runs out and neither do the battles. And, of course, everyone knows this, so none of us are afraid to die in war. Onwards, Nordic brothers, Sovngarde awaits!"
  XRD_custom_ideas: "Redoran Ideas"
  XRD_custom_ideas_bonus: "Redoran Ambitions"
  XRD_custom_ideas_start: "Redoran Traditions"
  XRD_idea_1: "The Warrior House"
  XRD_idea_1_desc: "House Redoran have always been the warrior House, the true defenders of Morrowind. Oh, things like Hlaalu gold and Telvanni magic are nice to have once in a while, but when our people are threatened, there’s nothing more precious than a Redoran sword. All in Veloth know this, and so we await the next honourable war with every fibre of our being, prepared to fight whoever seeks to despoil our beloved Morrowind."
  XRD_idea_2: "Unsullied Protectors"
  XRD_idea_2_desc: "When the Argonian hordes poured over the southern border of our land, the Dres were quickly overrun, the Hlaalu switched sides, the Indoril had their capital sacked, and even the Telvanni lands felt Argonian wrath at one point. Then the lizards tried to invade Veloth and take Baan Malur. What they didn’t realise is that invading rugged Veloth, with an army used to swamps, when the defenders are Redoran, is an impossible task. And so, Baan Malur came to be the new Dunmeri capital."
  XRD_idea_3: "Ashland Kwama"
  XRD_idea_3_desc: "Ask anyone in western Tamriel where their eggs come from and they’ll probably say something like “somewhere out east”. Morrowind is that somewhere out east, and our land is studded with colonies of kwama, the strange beasts that make the eggs. Even in the most desolate, ashy parts of our realm, there are hardy egg-mining Dunmer who have settled there. Truly, we Redoran can give even the most improbable places a thriving economy."
  XRD_idea_4: "Chitin and Bone"
  XRD_idea_4_desc: "Let the western imbeciles keep their metal armour, for we have far greater materials available to us. Dunmer smithing revolves around various insect parts, some from long-dead beasts, some from those that can be found anywhere in our land, along with some rather crafty uses of bone, a material often scorned by our neighbours. We’ll see who’s laughing when we can armour twice as many soldiers as they can… all without mines that are not of the egg variety."
  XRD_idea_5: "Weathering the Ash Storms"
  XRD_idea_5_desc: "It takes a certain spirit to live in the ash. Quite apart from the need to never get tired of innovative ways to cook kwama eggs, one must learn to face the ash storms – and worse – that whip across Vvardenfell, as if the whole island was a plane of Oblivion. But still, people come to our most hostile domains, and learn to be true Redoran. For if we can survive a proper Vvardenfell ash storm, we can survive anything."
  XRD_idea_6: "Rebuild Vvardenfell"
  XRD_idea_6_desc: "The Red Year left Vvardenfell a pale shadow of its former glory. Most cities collapsed or were buried in the ash, and to make it worse, the few that survived were mostly Telvanni. However, we Redoran are in the best position to rebuild Vvardenfell, house by house, town by town. Quite apart from adding half as much land again to our domain, it also gives us an excuse to annex the former Hlaalu areas of southwest Vvardenfell."
  XRD_idea_7: "A New Morrowind"
  XRD_idea_7_desc: "For hundreds of years, Morrowind was under the control of the Indoril and the Old Temple, with almost all power concentrated in the forbidding halls of Mournhold. Then the Cyrodiils came, and they made a second Morrowind, one which put as much power in the hands of Hlaalu moneymen in Narsis as it did in those of the paper-pushers of Ebonheart. Now, the Septims are gone, Ebonheart is Dunmer once more, and our nation’s capital is Baan Malur. From the ruins of the Accession War, let us build a third Morrowind, a new Morrowind… a Redoran Morrowind."
  XAK_custom_ideas: "Akasund Ideas"
  XAK_custom_ideas_bonus: "Akasund Ambitions"
  XAK_custom_ideas_start: "Akasund Traditions"
  XAK_idea_1: "People from the Portal"
  XAK_idea_1_desc: "Our land was created in a way unlike any other in Tamriel. We are exiles, outcasts, and adventurers who came from Akavir, through a part of Dagon's Deadlands that contained two portals to Nirn. With the help of the Argonian people, our unlikely band of migrants managed to traverse the deadly Plane, and emerge in Argonia, where we were promised land in the north. We got that land after the Argonians invaded their slaving neighbours. Now, at long last, we can rest, but we will never forget who we are, or where we come from."
  XAK_idea_2: "New Gods and Old"
  XAK_idea_2_desc: "Religion is a complex business in Akasund. We still have our old gods, but in order to survive in Tamriel, we must respect the gods of this land as well. It's easier said than done: the idea of multiple deities is normal for us as well as for those born in Tamriel, and besides, it turned out when we arrived here that some of our gods are actually the same. This should help Akasund people and Tamrielics accept each other, and perhaps contribute to lower unrest among Tamrielics in an expanded Akasund?"
  XAK_idea_3: "Katanas"
  XAK_idea_3_desc: "Since the first Akaviri invasion of Tamriel, swords modelled after the Akaviri weapons of the Potentates have been popular across the continent, especially among groups such as the Blades of the Third Era. However, they were quite rare, due to the very low number of smiths in Tamriel who knew how to forge them. Luckily for us, some swordsmiths crossed the Deadlands with us from the eastern lands... and so our entire army can be equipped with katanas."
  XAK_idea_4: "Further Akasund Syncretism"
  XAK_idea_4_desc: "Our mixing of religions also extends to culture. Right now, in Ikiru and Erudabe, our people are developing a culture and identity distinct from anything that's come before: not Tamrielic or Akaviri, but truly Akasund. Not only will this make our rule easier to accept for Tamrielics, but something alien to everyone has its advantages: nobody can accuse us of favouring one Tamrielic culture over another."
  XAK_idea_5: "Encourage the Huzimotu"
  XAK_idea_5_desc: "Nobody quite knows where the Huzimotu people came from, but they must have come from somewhere: isolated clans of fishermen along the mainland coast of the Inner Sea, who appear to be a mixture of outcast Dunmer and small numbers of Akaviri descendants left over from the Potentate era. Those on the Akasund coast were among the first to submit to our rule, as we have similar histories of being various kinds of outsider. Let us attract the western Huzimotu to our lands as well, for they know the Inner Sea better than anyone."
  XAK_idea_6: "Building on the Cursed"
  XAK_idea_6_desc: "There is a reason the Argonians gave us this exact land as our own. Dun Akafell, the largest city in the region, has been abandoned longer than anyone can remember, and few people here are willing to settle anywhere near it. Few, that is, except for Akaviri. Although we have made some effort to revere Aedra and Daedra, this curse does not seem to be related to them: rather, it is merely a superstition. Let us build our capital, Ikiru, near Dun Akafell: it would be a shame to waste perfectly good land."
  XAK_idea_7: "Of Dwemer and Dun Akafell"
  XAK_idea_7_desc: "Akasund is bursting with ruins of civilisations long gone: Dun Akafell, of course, but also Chunzefk, and some other Dwemer sites on the Erudabe peninsula. Many Tamrielics won't go near them... not even the Dwemer sites. How could they be cursed? Apparently, the Dwemer didn't even respect the gods of this world! It does not matter now, because here we are, not born in Tamriel, and rulers of a land with plenty of secrets to discover."
  XNT_custom_ideas: "Temple Ideas"
  XNT_custom_ideas_bonus: "Temple Ambitions"
  XNT_custom_ideas_start: "Temple Traditions"
  XNT_idea_1: "A Daedric Faith"
  XNT_idea_1_desc: "The men and western mer of this continent constantly bicker over which Aedra to worship and the correct way to worship them. But our Temple does not, and will never, revere Aedra above Daedra. We Dunmer owe our existence to Daedric Princes, and they still shape the world today, in stark contrast to the Aedric tradition of being dull as dishwater! As nobody disputes the existence of the Daedra, other religions sometimes have Daedric aspects to them, which should make them more receptive to New Temple teachings."
  XNT_idea_2: "The Converts' Zeal"
  XNT_idea_2_desc: "Just twenty years ago, most of our fellow Dunmer misguidedly followed the Tribunal, three minor divine beings who once inhabited Morrowind. Now, however, the people's eyes have been opened by those who stayed true, the Ashlanders and Dissidents. We must make sure that no Dunmer repeats the same mistakes as we did so recently... the Reclamations and Ancestors are here to stay."
  XNT_idea_3: "Intervention Magic"
  XNT_idea_3_desc: "In the Tribunal days, adventurers lost in Morrowind could call upon special Temple magic to be transported to the nearest place of worship. As this is usually in a town, the system saved the lives of many a soul lost in the wilderness. Although the doctrine of the temples has changed, we of the New Temple can still set up a similar system, which will be useful in war as well as peace – imagine a whole army materialising in the middle of your capital!"
  XNT_idea_4: "The Last of the Indoril"
  XNT_idea_4_desc: "House Indoril still exists, and still has some say in Dunmer affairs. However, it does not exist in the same way that, for example, the Redoran exist. Indoril is a formality: a series of titles used in the Temple, parallel to proper Temple rank. However, it can still be useful – very useful indeed. Should the people clamour for the return of the Indoril, it will be the Temple who they follow into battle."
  XNT_idea_5: "Fort of Bisandryon"
  XNT_idea_5_desc: "Ah, Bisandryon! Although old strongholds exist throughout Morrowind, especially on Vvardenfell, none are as fine as Bisandryon. Situated in the heart of Temple lands, it controls a key valley through the Nezuad mountains, yet it has been untouched for hundreds of years – even the Imperials didn't know how to use it. Now, though, there is nothing to stop us from making Bisandryon greater than it has ever been."
  XNT_idea_6: "Reclaim the Holy Sites"
  XNT_idea_6_desc: "We have managed to take control of Necrom, and have a fairly shaky hold on Mournhold-Almalexia. However, there are still many sites sacred to the Dunmer that are in impious, even hostile, hands. Who should control Mount Kand, or the Fields of Kummu? Why, the Temple. Isn't it obvious?"
  XNT_idea_7: "Temples Everywhere"
  XNT_idea_7_desc: "Other countries sometimes have a problem with diplomacy. Not every town will accept a Telvanni consulate, a Hlaalu trading post, or an An-Xileel mission. We of the Temple, however, do not have that problem anywhere in Morrowind. A temple is not political, it is a place of worship and of faith. Even the Telvanni reluctantly accept them into their towns. The Temple, then, is the only power in Morrowind that is truly everywhere."

  falyani_ideas_bonus: "Falyani Ambitions"
  falyani_ideas_start: "Falyani Traditions"
  falyani_idea_1: "Attract the Rightists"
  falyani_idea_1_desc: "The promise of new land in the northern reaches of the Argonian empire excites a certain kind of person. Those whose hearts lie with peace and tolerance do not tend to decide to move to a land so recently conquered from the people who held it for centuries, even if those people worked the land through enslaving Argonians. No, Falyani immigrants are largely Argonian nationalist zealots who love their people fiercely… and who are more than willing to fight the Dunmer once more if the need arises."
  falyani_idea_2: "Land of Broken Chains"
  falyani_idea_2_desc: "Jer Ahkrin and Kanadesit exist because of revenge. Revenge for a thousand years of slavery, of unimaginable suffering on the part of our people, of innocent Arnesian towns torn apart by greedy Dres plantation owners. No more! The slaves have cast off their chains, the plantations lie in ruins or have been converted into much smaller Argonian-owned farms, and Tear is no more. And so we, the Falyani Argonians, are here, and we know that we have a right to be here, whatever the dark elves say."
  falyani_idea_3: "The Argonian Preservation Acts"
  falyani_idea_3_desc: "What is to stop our invasion getting reversed without war? The Dunmer could start coming back, enduring whatever we throw at them in order to one day make up most of the population of Jer Ahkrin or Kanadesit, and overthrow the rulers of our lands… and it would be Morrowind once again. What’s to stop them from doing that? Nothing, as it stands. But we should make sure that no more than one in five of our population is non-Argonian through various acts and restrictions. That should stop any coup attempts."
  falyani_idea_4: "Sacred Nuhyas"
  falyani_idea_4_desc: "Tear, or Tyr Dres, the old capital of the vile House Dres, is no more: the capital of Jer Ahkrin is the former garrison town of Falyah, far from the old Tear. But it is still possible to go to the ruins of Tear, and reflect on what our people were put through by the Dunmer. Indeed, we have turned not just Tear, but the entirety of Nuhyas Point, into a memorial to our suffering. We will not allow it to be turned into just more farms!"
  falyani_idea_5: "Here to Stay"
  falyani_idea_5_desc: "Some thought that the Falyani would be a short-lived phenomenon, that within a decade of the Accession War ending, the borders would be back to where they were before. Even now, some maps still don’t show Jer Ahkrin as Argonian, because it’s seen as occupied territory… but even the Redoran signed the peace! We are here to stay, and the Deshaan will be Argonian for at least another century or two."
  falyani_idea_6: "Legacy of the Accession"
  falyani_idea_6_desc: "We arrived in Jer Ahkrin and in Kanadesit with spears in our hands, and most of us still have them in our new homes in the new north Argonia. We are warriors, and proud of it: we leave the magic for the Atrons, and the trading for the Hlaalu. When the drums of war sound once more, we will be the first to take up our old spears and fight for all that is Argonian."
  falyani_idea_7: "Grow the Hist"
  falyani_idea_7_desc: "We have spread our people and our culture further north than they have ever spread. But why stop at that achievement? We cannot be truly Argonian without Hist trees to call our own, and Jer Ahkrin does directly border the forests and jungles of Arnesia. And so, we will plant tree after glorious tree. We will flood the plains. We will bring crates and crates of our most treasured plants and fungi from the south. We will build our own, Falyani-made xanmeer. And one day, we will have done enough to plant real Hist trees. Only then can we be sure that this land will forever be Argonian."
  kamanese_ideas: "Northern Argonian Ideas"
  kamanese_ideas_bonus: "Northern Argonian Ambitions"
  kamanese_ideas_start: "Northern Argonian Traditions"
  kamanese_idea_1: "Memories of Ebonheart"
  kamanese_idea_1_desc: "When the Akaviri invaded in the Second Era, most of our fellow Saxhleel decided to retreat into their swamp, pretending Tamriel was not under threat, rather than even contemplate fighting alongside Dunmer or even Nords. The exceptions, of course, were the Kamanese and Arnesian people, who managed to secure their freedom in exchange for the fight for Tamriel. Although relations with our northern neighbours are not as amicable as they were then, some still remember northern Argonians as allies that can be trusted."
  kamanese_idea_2: "Kamanese Hybrid Towns"
  kamanese_idea_2_desc: "Kamanese Argonians, when it comes to building their nation, are among the most resourceful people in Tamriel. Look around Kamanai, and you’ll see Ayleid, Barsaebic, Dres, Velothi, and Cyrodilic structures, all being used by Argonians instead of left as ruins. Wherever we go in Tamriel, someone else will have been there first, and we can always use whatever has been left behind by that someone to our advantage."
  kamanese_idea_3: "Shellback Troops"
  kamanese_idea_3_desc: "In most of Argonia, having too much armour is more of a burden than an aid in battle, due to the harsh climate and swampy terrain. In the north, however, we learnt long ago that we must learn to fight on plains and mountains as well as in our native marshes. So we scoured our homeland, piecing together useful-looking parts of plant, animal, and fungus alike, until we were able to forge a kind of armour that works just as well as the metal plates of the West. Any Argonian can fight in the south, but only Kamanese Shellbacks can tackle the north as well."
  kamanese_idea_4: "The Arnesian Gambit"
  kamanese_idea_4_desc: "Arnesia and Kamanai, apart from their long history and enviable military record, are known in the rest of Tamriel for a rather different reason – smuggling! Routes that Argonians use for illicit trading criss-cross the marshes, the greatest of the lot being the Arnesian Gambit, an epic trail that spans land and water on its way between the two great markets of Thorn and Narsis. Numerous villages and pirate settlements make their living from the Gambit, for although we might be able to live on hunting alone, thriving is another matter."
  kamanese_idea_5: "Trials of Hissmir"
  kamanese_idea_5_desc: "Kamanai can lay claim to some of the most important Hist sites in the land. Perhaps the most important of these is K’omatur, but another, almost as important, shrine lies just to the northwest of it, at a place called Hissmir. Here, if an Argonian passes the three trials of Mind, Heart, and Fang, they are said to be able to commune directly with the Hist. While this was seen as not much more than a cult for much of history, the rise of the An-Xileel has made Hissmir part of the central government structure, showering prestige on the northern marshes."
  kamanese_idea_6: "Jewel of the East"
  kamanese_idea_6_desc: "Ah, Thorn, the true Jewel of the East! Granted, we had to raze Tear to the ground in order to let Thorn undisputedly claim the title, but it’s been well and truly claimed now. Thorn is a city of merchants, legal and otherwise: it’s the home of the closest thing Argonia has to a Thieves’ Guild, and, of course, marks the start of the Arnesian Gambit. And so dealing with a Thorn merchant and walking away with a decent deal requires one to employ every trick ever thought up by man, mer, or Saxhleel. Merchants raised in Thorn, therefore, may have a rather easier time negotiating anywhere else on the continent than those without Arnesian experience."
  kamanese_idea_7: "The Survivors"
  kamanese_idea_7_desc: "Kamanai and Arnesia have endured century after century of pain, from Aldmeri atrocities in the Second Era to those of the Septims in the Third. Most of all, northern Argonia faced the brunt of the Dres slave trade, losing family after family, tribe after tribe, to the misery of the Deshaan saltrice plantations. But that is, at long last, behind us now. We are the survivors. And now that we have our Kamanai, our Arnesia, we will never let it fall."
