  XAT_custom_ideas: "Atron Ideas"
  XAT_custom_ideas_bonus: "Atron Ambitions"
  XAT_custom_ideas_start: "Atron Traditions"
  XAT_idea_1: "Velothi Roots"
  XAT_idea_1_desc: "The Atron plain has not always been Argonian land. Our greatest city, Archon, was reputedly founded by Velothi Dunmer; over the following centuries, it became a melting pot of peoples that every so often descended into war. Although this legacy was all but ended by the Knahaten Flu, we have never ceased to look back on the Velothi, Lilmothiit and Kothringi, and we can use this to build an Atron society distinct from our cousins in the marsh."
  XAT_idea_2: "Let Gold Mean Nothing"
  XAT_idea_2_desc: "A land with the best Alteration mages in Tamriel sometimes faces unique problems. One of these is that of currency. Using gold coins, like the old Cyrodilic septims, simply doesn't work, as silver is easily transmutable into gold by Alteration mages. Therefore, we must turn away from metal, and use enchanted daedra remains as currency. This also has the added benefit of letting us manipulate the currency by changing which daedra are used."
  XAT_idea_3: "Settler-Form Dominance"
  XAT_idea_3_desc: "Atronium is one of the few societies in Argonia where settler-form Argonians - referred to by ignorant outsiders as \"female\" Argonians - are held in higher esteem than hunter-form Argonians. Thus, our leaders are some of the least arrogant and least reckless on the continent. As settler-forms have a natural talent for magic and scholarly learning rather than tracking whatever beast happens to be in the right kind of swamp, Atron administrative and military methods tend to be more advanced than in some other parts of eastern Tamriel."
  XAT_idea_4: "Port of Nansyokka"
  XAT_idea_4_desc: "Argonians have a profoundly different outlook on some parts of life than men and mer. Atrons are perhaps the least reactionary people in Argonia. The combination of these two factors results in many non-Argonians with certain tendencies moving to Atronium in order to do what they will without persecution. Nansyokka, a port near Enganka, has become famous for such things, and its renown makes traders with ulterior motives more likely to be persuaded to trade there."
  XAT_idea_5: "Land Beyond the Marshes"
  XAT_idea_5_desc: "Atronium is mostly plains, but it is separated from the rest of Tamriel by Murkwood and the Black Marshes. When in those treacherous regions, the idea of the eternal swampy jungle actually ending becomes fanciful, and so Atronium has acquired a sort of promised-land status in the rest of Tamriel. Because of this, many people who were outsiders in their homeland have set off southeast, hoping to reach Archon or Jer Vanyal. These immigrants bring intriguing ideas from the rest of Tamriel with them, and can be very useful to the Atron state!"
  XAT_idea_6: "Atron Pride"
  XAT_idea_6_desc: "We are not denizens of the Black Marshes. We do not spend our days running through jungle, trying to remember what is poison and what is not. And our language consists of more than one-word sentences. We are not like those in Helstrom and Blackrose - we are Atron, and none of us will forget that!"
  XAT_idea_7: "Military Alteration"
  XAT_idea_7_desc: "Why must Alteration be used only for lock-picking and party tricks? The ability to change the world around us is an incredibly powerful tool in the right hands. Yet nobody has used it for military matters yet. We cannot understand why. We should create specialised Alteration military corps, so when our armies next meet the enemy, they will find their swords have turned to quicksilver before they land a single blow."
  argonian_idea_1: "Hunting Traditions"
  argonian_idea_1_desc: "Where the soft-skinned outlanders see nothing but impenetrable jungle and marsh, we see our homeland, and it is as bountiful as any of those arbitrary rectangles of grain the Cyrodiils appear to subsist on. Every plant, fungus, fish and beast of the Black Marshes can be used for something; if not food, then medicine, or perhaps a poison to defeat larger creatures. And yet the Cyrodiils say that their way, their way of sitting around while eating the same food day after day, is \"civilisation\"? They will soon see how wrong they are when they first set foot in our Argonia and try and cook a trodh fish."
  argonian_idea_2: "Argonia the Treacherous"
  argonian_idea_2_desc: "Many invaders have tried to tame the swamps and jungles of Murkwood and Karanake. Few have lived to tell the tale, and none have succeeded: even the supposed might of the Septim Empire ruled three cities in western Argonia and left it at that. For how can Cyrodiils or Dunmer even reach Helstrom, the heart of our homeland, when it is surrounded by the most impenetrable land in all Tamriel?"
  argonian_idea_3: "Free Argonians"
  argonian_idea_3_desc: "Since the Daedra of Mehrunes Dagon stalked our continent, we have declared official independence from Cyrodiil, throwing off the shackles that have kept our north constantly threatened by Dres slavers and our west presided over by Imperial money-makers. Now Argonia is free, and nobody will take that freedom away again."
  argonian_idea_4: "Riding the Roots"
  argonian_idea_4_desc: "Beneath Argonia lies an intricate system of wide, hollow roots, inhabited by curious worm-like creatures larger than any Argonian. Our people have long used these as a kind of inland trade-wind, \"riding the roots\" from one side of Argonia to the other in the space of a few hours. Of course, they cannot be relied on, and change with the seasons; but every so often, the roots align, and our armies can strike deep into the heart of our enemies' land."
  argonian_idea_5: "Expand the Hist"
  argonian_idea_5_desc: "Although we are free people, every one of us knows that we have some unassailable duty to the Hist, the great trees scattered across Argonia that are vital to almost any Argonian ritual one can think of. But why must the Hist be limited to Argonia? If we can take more foreign land, then we could expand Argonia by encouraging Hist trees to take root in newly-created swamp, ensuring the continuation of our culture in an ever-expanding area of Tamriel."
  argonian_idea_6: "Hist Gender"
  argonian_idea_6_desc: "Argonians do not have genders in the Cyrodilic sense of the term: our people are either hunter-form or settler-form, the former being naturally adapted to survival in the deep marshes while the latter has adapted to more cerebral matters. Which form an Argonian becomes is generally decided with Hist sap close to birth, but an Argonian's form can still change with the ingestion of more Hist sap. Therefore, in times of war, we should increase our fighting force by encouraging willing settler-form Argonians to become hunter-forms for the duration of the war effort."
  argonian_idea_7: "Impenetrable Language"
  argonian_idea_7_desc: "The Jel or Histic languages native to Argonia are seen across Tamriel as perhaps the hardest languages for an outsider to understand. In particular, the language found in central Argonia is closer to raw thought than to other languages, with some sentences consisting of just one word with large helpings of intonation and context. This impenetrability should make sure that Argonian secrets are never leaked to the outside world."
  argonian_ideas: "Inner Argonian Ideas"
  argonian_ideas_bonus: "Inner Argonian Ambitions"
  argonian_ideas_start: "Inner Argonian Traditions"
  XSE_custom_ideas: "Seydani Ideas"
  XSE_custom_ideas_bonus: "Seydani Ambitions"
  XSE_custom_ideas_start: "Seydani Traditions"
  XSE_idea_1: "Old Gideon"
  XSE_idea_1_desc: "Gideon, the capital of Seydahnil, has been the chief trading city of western Argonia for centuries. The Septim legacy, in particular, has left Gideon with excellent trading infrastructure, which we can still use to our advantage now we are independent - our eternal rival in trade, Leyawiin, had better watch out..."
  XSE_idea_2: "Cyrod Connections"
  XSE_idea_2_desc: "Although we have thrown off the shackles of Cyrodilic rule, our people were among the last Argonians to formally declare independence, and there are still some in Blackwood who sympathise with our new nation. By portraying ourselves as a nation which looks west as well as east, we can gain more influence in southern Cyrodilic matters."
  XSE_idea_3: "The Foxfire Coast"
  XSE_idea_3_desc: "The coast south of Gideon is home to several strange species of plants and fungi, which seem to naturally glow after the sun sets. Other than inspiring mages to make their home in south Seydahnil, and drawing countless admirers from all over Tamriel, the so-called Foxfire Coast helps our ships see more clearly at night. Perhaps we could find a way to make other coasts glow in the same way..."
  XSE_idea_4: "Gideon Tower"
  XSE_idea_4_desc: "Gideon is a very old city. Some have even said that a settlement around modern Gideon has existed since the Ayleid days, although Seydahnil never seems to have ever been anything other than Argonian. However, there is a strange, prehistoric tower in the middle of Gideon, its sheer size and stark contrast to the rest of the city ensuring that it dominates the sky. That tower has never fallen, even in the face of so many waves of invaders. And as long as the tower remains standing, Gideon will never fall again, we are sure of it."
  XSE_idea_5: "Melting Pot"
  XSE_idea_5_desc: "Gideon's position at the centre of Western Argonian trade has attracted men and mer from all over Tamriel, and some who are reputed to be from lands beyond it. Their influence is such that the speech of Gideon has morphed into something unintelligible to those living outside it - even other Seydani Argonians find it confusing. With all these foreign people come foreign ideas - we don't need to work as hard as most states do when dealing with problems of administration, as somewhere has probably already found a solution, and there are most likely people already in Seydahnil hailing from that somewhere."
  XSE_idea_6: "Seydani Conjuration"
  XSE_idea_6_desc: "Seydahnil has a history of producing Conjuration mages, in contrast to the Mysticism of Leyawiin and the Alteration of Archon. In particular, the summoning of daedra has long been a Seydani speciality, making the Oblivion Crisis somewhat easier to handle than in other parts of Tamriel. This has had many other effects, including Seydani portals being partially responsible for the formation of Akasunde, but one particularly important one is the reduced cost of armies - we can easily replace some of the men in our armies with daedric thralls."
  XSE_idea_7: "Blurred Identity"
  XSE_idea_7_desc: "As the westernmost part of Argonia, Seydahnil has sometimes been seen as a proxy for Cyrodiil by eastern Argonians. However, in Cyrodiil, Seydahnil is sometimes seen as a proxy for Argonia. This has created a situation where an independent Seydahnil can to some extent manipulate its identity to best suit its interests. We may be Argonian, or Cyrodilic. But we will never be truly foreign to either side."
